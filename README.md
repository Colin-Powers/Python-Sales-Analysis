# Python-Sales-Analysis
## About:
### In this project I use Python and Jupyter Notebook to clean and explore fake sales data. I prefer to use Jupyter Notebook because it allows you to see the code and its output next to one another. The goal of this project is to help a hypothetical business understand their customer base better. 
## Cleaning the Data:
### The first step in cleaning the data was to remove all of the NaN values from the data. NaN stands for "Not a Number" and is an undefined value that will throw an error if used in a calculation. After removing all of the NaN values I removed all of the orders that did not have an order date. In this data, incomplete order dates were represented with "Order Date" instead of an actual date. Next, I moved on to adding a month and city column that made future analysis and visualizations easier to create.
## Analysis:
